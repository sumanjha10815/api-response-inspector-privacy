    <h1>Privacy Policy for API Response Inspector</h1>
    <p class="updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      API Response Inspector (“the Extension”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a Chrome
      DevTools extension that allows developers to inspect, analyze, and export
      API network requests and responses generated by web pages they explicitly
      choose to inspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension accesses, uses, stores, and
      protects data in accordance with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program
      Policies, including Google’s User Data and Limited Use requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Access and Collection</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Data Accessed by the Extension</h3>
    <p>
      When the Extension is enabled within Chrome DevTools, it accesses network
      traffic from the currently inspected tab only, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>URLs of API requests</li>
      <li>HTTP request methods</li>
      <li>Request headers (including cookies and authorization headers)</li>
      <li>Request bodies</li>
      <li>Response headers</li>
      <li>Response bodies</li>
      <li>HTTP status codes</li>
      <li>Network timing information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Extension also accesses cookies and related request metadata as part of
      Chrome’s DevTools network inspection APIs.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Sensitive and Personal Data Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension does not intentionally collect personal data. However,
      because it inspects raw API traffic, captured data may include sensitive
      or personal information depending on the behavior of the inspected
      website, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authentication tokens and credentials</li>
      <li>Personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
      <li>Financial or payment-related data</li>
      <li>Health-related data</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Personal communications</li>
      <li>Any other data transmitted via API calls</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All accessed data originates exclusively from websites chosen by the user
      for inspection.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Purpose of Data Use</h2>
    <p>
      Data accessed by the Extension is used solely and exclusively to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display API request and response details in Chrome DevTools</li>
      <li>Enable debugging and analysis of network activity</li>
      <li>Allow users to generate and download HAR (HTTP Archive) files</li>
      <li>Support scheduled capture jobs configured by the user</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Extension does not use collected data for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Transmission</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Local Processing and Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All data is processed and stored locally on the user’s device</li>
      <li>Storage uses Chrome’s <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API</li>
      <li>Data is never transmitted off the user’s device</li>
      <li>No remote servers, cloud storage, or external services are involved</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 No Data Sharing or Selling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share user data</li>
      <li>
        We do not use analytics, telemetry, advertising, or tracking technologies
      </li>
      <li>We do not share data with third parties under any circumstances</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Network data is retained in memory only while the DevTools panel is open
      </li>
      <li>
        Scheduled capture jobs and HAR files remain stored locally until deleted
        by the user
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Users may delete all stored data at any time by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearing captured requests</li>
      <li>Deleting scheduled jobs or HAR files</li>
      <li>Uninstalling the Extension</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Uninstalling the Extension removes all locally stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. User Control and Consent</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Extension only operates when explicitly enabled by the user in Chrome
        DevTools
      </li>
      <li>Users have full control over what data is captured</li>
      <li>
        Users can stop data collection at any time by closing DevTools or
        disabling the Extension
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Extension does not collect data in the background without user
      awareness.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All data remains on the user’s local device</li>
      <li>No external network communication is performed</li>
      <li>
        The Extension relies solely on Chrome’s built-in DevTools APIs
      </li>
      <li>
        Reasonable technical measures are used to prevent unauthorized access
        within the browser environment
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Compliance With Chrome Web Store Policies</h2>
    <p>
      API Response Inspector complies with the Chrome Web Store policies by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessing user data only for a single, clearly disclosed purpose</li>
      <li>Processing all data locally</li>
      <li>Not transferring data to external servers</li>
      <li>Not using data for advertising, analytics, or profiling</li>
      <li>Not selling or sharing user data</li>
      <li>
        Providing users full control over data collection and deletion
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be
      reflected by updating the <strong>Last Updated</strong> date at the top of
      this document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the
      updated Privacy Policy.
